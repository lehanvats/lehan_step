## **Palindrome Checker App**

The objective of the **PalindromeChecker App** is to design and implement a **console-based Java application** that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and **data structure concepts**.

## **UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message**

**Goal:** Display a welcome message and app details at startup.

**Actor:** User

**Flow:**

* Program starts.
* JVM invokes the `main()` method.
* Application name is displayed.
* Application version is displayed.
* Program continues to next use case or exits.

**Key Concepts used in UC1:**

* **Class** – Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.
* **Main Method** – Entry point of the Java application with the signature  
    `public static void main(String[] args)`.
* **Static Keyword** – Allows the JVM to invoke the `main()` method without creating an object.
* **Console Output** – `System.out.println()` is used to display messages on the console.
* **Application Flow Control** – Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing begins.

## **UC2: Print a Hardcoded Palindrome Result**

**Goal:** Display whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.

**Actor:** User

**Flow:**

* Program starts.
* Hardcoded string is checked.
* Result is printed.
* Program exits.

**Key Concepts used in UC2:**

* **Class** – In Java, even the simplest program must be written inside a class, as a class acts as a container to hold program logic.
* **Main Method** – Entry point of the Java application with the signature  
    `public static void main(String[] args)`.
* **Static Keyword** – Allows the JVM to invoke the `main()` method without creating an object of the class.
* **String** – A built-in Java class used to store and manipulate textual data. Here, it stores the word to be checked for a palindrome.
* **String Literal** – Text enclosed within double quotes (`"madam"`), stored in the String constant pool.
* **Conditional Statement (if-else)** – Used to evaluate whether the given string satisfies the palindrome condition.
* **Console Output** – `System.out.println()` is used to display the result on the console.

## **UC3: Palindrome Check Using String Reverse**

**Goal:** Check whether a string is a palindrome by reversing it.

**Flow:**

* Reverse string using loop.
* Compare original and reversed.
* Display result.

**Key Concepts used in UC3:**

* **Loop (for loop)** – Used to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
* **String Immutability** – In Java, String objects are immutable; every modification creates a new String object.
* **String Concatenation (+)** – Used to build the reversed string character by character (introduced here to later discuss drawbacks).
* **equals() Method** – Used to compare the actual content of two String objects instead of memory references.

## **UC4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check**

**Goal:** Convert string to character array and compare characters.

**Flow:**

* Convert string to `char[]`.
* Use two-pointer approach.
* Compare start & end characters.

**Key Concepts used in UC4:**

* **Character Array (char[])** – A primitive array used to store individual characters of a string for index-based access.
* **Array Indexing** – Accessing elements using index positions starting from 0.
* **Two-Pointer Technique** – One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end, reducing unnecessary comparisons.
* **Time Complexity Awareness** – Demonstrates efficient comparison without creating extra objects.

## **UC5: Stack-Based Palindrome Checker**

**Goal:** Use stack to reverse characters and validate palindrome.

**Flow:**

* Push characters into stack.
* Pop and compare.
* Print result.

**Key Concepts used in UC5:**

* **Stack** – A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
* **Push Operation** – Used to insert characters into the stack.
* **Pop Operation** – Used to remove characters from the stack in reverse order.
* **Reversal Logic** – Stack naturally reverses the order of elements, making it suitable for palindrome validation.

## **UC6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check**

**Goal:** Demonstrate FIFO vs LIFO using Queue and Stack.

**Flow:**

* Enqueue characters
* Push characters to stack
* Compare dequeue vs pop

**Key Concepts used in UC6:**

* **Queue** – A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
* **Enqueue & Dequeue Operations** – Used to insert and remove elements from the queue.
* **Stack vs Queue** – Demonstrates the behavioral difference between LIFO and FIFO structures.
* **Logical Comparison** – Matching dequeue (queue) output with pop (stack) output to validate palindrome logic.
* **Data Structures: Queue, Stack**

## **UC7: Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Checker**

**Goal:** Use Deque to compare front and rear elements.

**Flow:**

* Insert characters into deque
* Remove first & last
* Compare until empty

**Key Concepts used in UC7:**

* **Deque (Double Ended Queue)** – A data structure that allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear ends.
* **Front and Rear Access** – Enables direct comparison of first and last characters.
* **Optimized Data Handling** – Eliminates the need for separate reversal data structures.
* **Data Structure: Deque**

## **UC8: Linked List Based Palindrome Checker**

**Goal:** Check palindrome using singly linked list.

**Flow:**

* Convert string to linked list
* Reverse second half
* Compare halves

**Key Concepts used in UC8:**

* **Singly Linked List** – A dynamic data structure where elements are connected using node references.
* **Node Traversal** – Sequential access to elements using next references.
* **Fast and Slow Pointer Technique** – Used to find the middle of the linked list efficiently.
* **In-Place Reversal** – Reverses the second half of the list without extra memory.
* **Data Structure: Singly Linked List**

## **UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker**

**Goal:** Check palindrome using recursion.

**Flow:**

* Recursive call compares start & end
* Base condition exits recursion

**Key Concepts used in UC9:**

* **Recursion** – A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
* **Base Condition** – Prevents infinite recursion and terminates the recursive calls.
* **Call Stack** – Memory structure used to manage method calls during recursion.
* **Data Structure: Call Stack**

## **UC10: Case-Insensitive & Space-Ignored Palindrome**

**Goal:** Ignore spaces and case while checking a palindrome.

**Flow:**

* Normalize string
* Apply previous logic

**Key Concepts used in UC10:**

* **String preprocessing**
* **Regular expressions**
* **Data Structure: String / Array**

## **UC11: Object-Oriented Palindrome Service**

**Goal:** Encapsulate palindrome logic in a class.

**Flow:**

* Create PalindromeChecker class
* Expose checkPalindrome() method

**Key Concepts used in UC11 (OOPS):**

* **Encapsulation**
* **Single Responsibility Principle**
* **Data Structure: Internal (Stack / Array)**
